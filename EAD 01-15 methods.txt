On the same level as the main function, you can define methods

method parameters are constants
they can be changed using a 'pass by reference'

out variable
vs
variable

Out variable passes a reference to the container variable, allowing its content
to be 'changed'

variable passes a reference to the value of the container. You cannot reassign it, you arent changing its value

In string literals $"{variable:C}"
:C formats a variable to currency
These formatting statements allow you to format strings or other values
