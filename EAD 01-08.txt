C# as a language
It is a compiled language
It has to be converted to an executable
its converted into IL: intermediary language

IL is run by:
CLR: common language run time
C# is prepared into a 


C# is great for for dotnet

python is great for data science

C# is a strongly typed language, Variables must be specified
To set a variable in C#:

datatype variableName = value;

if age > 50:
	print("You are gen x")

C# has tons of data types
We have strings "" which are a set of characters
AND
char which have '' single quotes and 
C# comments
// comment
/* multi-line comments
*
*/

Floats

float floatName = 3.14159f; 4 bytes up to 7 points of accuracy
you need to end them in f so the computer knows its a float
double doubleName = 3.1415926535; 8 bytes up to 16 points of accuracy
decimal decimalName = 3.14159m;
you need to end them with m so the computer knows its a float

universal variable
var myVariable = 10; The data type is determined at runtime
you must assign this a value to let the computer figure out what it is


Dictionary<string, int> mynary = new Dictionary<string, int>();

Boilerplate stuff:
namespace is a parent structure for the code file
you can access a namespace with another file using its name

internal class Program
an access modifier

static voidMain(string[] args)
{
}
mandatory component that contains all executed code for the file
this is the main function
