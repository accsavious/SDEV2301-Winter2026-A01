1. What is the result of this integer division example:
    double number = 9 / 4;
2.25
The answer is 2, because 9 and 4 are integers
to make either a double(a kind of float) you need to give them a decimal point
like double number = 9 / 4.0;
2. Which data type represents true/false?
bool
3. What is the default value of an uninitialized int field in a class?
0
4. Difference between var and explicit types? (short answer)
var type is interpreted when the code is compiled
explicit types are determined in code.
Var cannot be initialized without a value, as they need a value to determine their
type.
5. Identify and correct the missing semicolon line.
6. What happens if you assign a string to an int? (short answer)
This will show an error in the code
