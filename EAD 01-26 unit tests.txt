This is an automated test that tests a unit of code
You can add a unit test:
right click the solution -> add -> project -> xUnit Test Project

Follow a naming convention
In our class its 
MethodName_State_ExpectedResult
ex for a calculator adding test:
Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum()

Different projects cant 'see' eachother without a project reference

we have a [] tag above the test class
[Fact] to test a variable
[Theory] can test multiple different values

dependencies -right click-> add project reference -> select project to reference
inside the test,
we need to
Arrange
Make an instance of the class or whatever
Act
test the code into a variable
Assert
Use Asser.method(testVariable)

Then you can run with 

for [theory] tag
you need variables as parameters in the test
public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectSum(int a, int b, int expectedSum)
and code the test with these variables

just below the [Theory] tag, place [InlineData()] tags
In these tags, pass arguments for the test, like
[InlineData(2,3,5)]
[InlineData(5,6,11)]

Tests should only test one thing
