For database entities in classes, we can mark a relationship like this:
for a one to many relationship
in the parent table
public List<ChildClass> ChildClass { get; set; } =new();
in the child class
public Course? Course { get; set; }

protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
var dbPath = Path.Combine(
	AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, "..", "..", "..", "school.db"
	);

dbPath = Path.GetFullPath(dbPath);
optionsBuilder.UseSqlite($"Data Source={dbPath}");
}

Then in the modelBuilder for the parent,
add:
b.HasMany(c => c.Students)
.WithOne(s => s.Course!);

If your program has an uknown issue
Build -> rebuild / clean
it rebuilds the file

Commands
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
