Linq - a tech built into C# for querying lists or dictionaries
Its reminiscent of SQL
Syntax for Linq QUERY

var queryQuery = from thing in things
	where thing.number >= 5
	orderby thing.name descending
	select thing;

Interface defines behaviors for a class it extends
IEnumerable

OR
Using list methods
var value = things.Where(thing => thing.number >= 5)
.OrderByDescending(thing => thing.value);

PROJECTION - 
var names = students.Where(s => s.Name.Contains("e"))
    .Select(s => s.Name);

foreach (string name in names)
{
    Console.WriteLine(name);
}



GROUP
var groupByName = from s in students
	group s by s.Name[0] into g // makes each name a group
	select g;

foreach (var group in groupByName)
	{
		Console.WriteLine(group.Key);
	}
this will group students by first letter in their name


var groupPassFail = from s in students
                orderby s.Name descending
                group s by (s.Grade >= 70 ? "Pass" : "Fail") // sorts into 
                into g
                select g;
foreach (var group in groupPassFail)
{
    Console.WriteLine(group.Key);
    foreach (Student s in group)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{s.Name,-10} {s.Grade}");
    }
}


String interpolation
We can reserve a number of characters for a string with a , followed by an int
$"{thing.value, -10}"
The value is negative to make things left aligned,
If its positive, the data will be right aligned.
