private not accessed outside class
public accessed anywhere
protected: only accessed by itself and its children

public abstract class Classname
abstract classes are used only used for inheritance

abstract and virtual methods
abstract: Children of this class must have this method.
if the abstract method isn't 

virutal: can be overridden

When using the constructor in a C# class:
to serve values to the base constructor, you need to reference it with
public Circle(double radius, string color) : base(color) <- this 

C# Iterables
Lists: a collection of items
MyClass[] array;
List<MyClass> list;
Array: a collection of items with FIXED number of items
For an array
Circle[] circles = new Circle[3];
^this array will have 3 locations, they must all be circles

If an array isnt full, the empty spot will be null
if we try to access it, the program can crash

if (item == null)
	continue; (skip this item)

Rectangle[] rectanges =
{
    new Rectangle(4,10, "blue"),
    new Rectangle(7,12, "red"),
    new Rectangle(12, 2, "purple"),
};
This will automaticall make an array with a size of 3

Polymorphism
You can make a list with a type of the parent class that can have multiple
items of other inheriting classes
List<Shape> shapes = new List<Shape>()
{
    new Circle(4, "Slime Green"),
    new Rectangle(3, 8, "Red"),
    new Circle(7, "Blurple")
};

The master class of all types is object
List<object> obj = new List<object>()
{
	anything
}

Casting
Circle c = (Circle)shape;

interfaces
doesnt need public on variables and methods
A class can inherit from a class, and an interface

Passing by ref
ex:
ref string variableName
This passes the variable rather than just the value into the method

similar to out keyword. Difference, out keyword expects it to be changed

NOT COVERED IN CLASS
Composition - using classes as components
If a inherited attribute has nothing to do with the child.
Instead we can make a class to represent an attribute, and give children this class attribute.
